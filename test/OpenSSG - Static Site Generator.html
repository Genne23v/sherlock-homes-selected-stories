  <h1>OpenSSG - Static Site Generator</h1>
  <p>
What it does is, as I explained above, that it generates static website on terminal. It gets text file from user specified text file or folder and translate it to HTML file. So basically it turns text files into website!</p>
  <p>It is built with Java. My primary language is Javascript. And I believe I used C and C++ much more than Java. Maybe I'm not right, but what I realized from my co-op experience is that I need to be proficient in C# or Java as both languages are widely used object-oriented languages in web development. I had some experiences with C#. I prefer UNIX terminal to Windows Powershell. That's why I chose Java in this project.</p>
